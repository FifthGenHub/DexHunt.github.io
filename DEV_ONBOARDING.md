# DexHuntHub Personal Dev Onboarding & Engineering Guide

> **Note:** Your local folder can be named `DexHuntHub`, `DexHunt.github.io`, or anything you like. The folder name does not affect your code or git history. You can push/pull to any GitHub repo (FifthGenHub, DexHuntHub, etc.) as needed. Just make sure you are in the correct folder when running git commands.

Welcome, DexHunt Dev! This is your personal engineering playbook—use it to stay organized, focused, and always know what to do next as you build, secure, and launch DexHunt.

---

## 1. Local Dev Environment
- [x] Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
- [x] Clone the repo and run `npm install` (if using dependencies)
- [x] Set up your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended)
- [x] Familiarize yourself with the project structure

---

## 2. Coding Standards & Best Practices
- [ ] Use clear, consistent naming and modular code
- [ ] Add comments for all complex logic
- [ ] Keep functions small and focused
- [ ] Avoid code duplication—reuse and refactor
- [ ] Use `.env` for secrets (never commit private keys)

---

## 3. Git & Version Control
- [ ] Commit early, commit often, and write clear messages
- [ ] Use branches for new features or experiments
- [ ] Push to remote regularly (even if private)
- [ ] Tag releases and major milestones

---

## 4. Testing & QA
- [x] Write unit tests for all core logic (see `js/index.test.js`)
- [x] Manually test all UI flows (wallet, duel, shop, leaderboard)
- [x] Test on multiple browsers and devices
- [x] Check for regressions after every major change

---

## 5. Security & Compliance
- [x] Never expose private keys or sensitive data in code
- [x] Validate all user input (client and server)
- [x] Regularly review dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [x] Keep legal, privacy, and terms pages up to date

---

## 6. Blockchain & Wallet Integration
- [x] Use Solana web3.js for wallet and transaction logic
- [x] Test wallet connect/disconnect, transaction signing, and error handling
- [x] Simulate mainnet/testnet flows before going live

---

## 7. Deployment & CI/CD
- [x] Use a staging branch or environment for pre-prod testing
- [x] Automate builds and deploys if possible

---

## 9. When Ready to Onboard Others
- [x] Prepare a public `CONTRIBUTING.md` with code standards and PR process
- [x] Document all APIs, endpoints, and data models
- [x] Set up code review and merge guidelines

---

## 10. Stay Inspired
- [x] Remember why you started DexHunt
- [x] Keep learning—Web3, eSports, and gaming are always evolving
