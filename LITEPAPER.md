## 🎯 What is DexHunt: Reflex Showdown?

**DexHunt: Reflex Showdown** is a Solana-powered, reflex-based arcade game.

You click fast. You win.
You miss? You lose.

No luck. No scams. Just speed.

***🗓️ Updated: June 9 2025 — DexHunt: Reflex Showdown Beta is now live with mock payouts and reflex duel logic fully integrated.***

## 💡 What Makes \$DEXHUNT Different

* **🧠 Skill-to-Win:** Real-time reflex duels, not speculation
* **🎯 Cosmetic Upgrades Only:** Gun skins, reticles, and sound variants — no pay-to-win
* **🔥 Burn Mechanic (Post-Bonding):** 80% of in-game spend burns tokens, 20% goes to dev wallet
* **🏪 PixelShop Live:** Buy custom skins using \$DEXHUNT
* **📊 Full Transparency:** Mint renounced, supply locked, game and utility logic published

> ⚠️ Burn + Utility mechanics activate **after bonding curve** to ensure legal compliance.

## 💸 The Token — \$DEXHUNT

\$DEXHUNT fuels the ecosystem:

* Used in-game for utility-based rewards
* Earned by skill — not speculation
* No premines, no hidden emissions, no team wallets
* Launch via Pump.fun — fair launch, no presale

💡 **\$DEXHUNT is a testnet-only token during Beta. No real-world value until launch.**

---

## 🪙 Token Supply (Fixed Forever)

* Total Supply: **1,000,000,000 \$DEXHUNT**
* 🔐 Mint Authority: **Renounced** (can’t be changed)
* Key Allocations:

  * 50% — Player Skill Rewards
  * 20% — Team (Vested)
  * 20% — Liquidity + Launch
  * 8% — Marketing + Bounties
  * 2% — Ecosystem Reserve

---

## 📊 How the Token Works (Post-Bonding Activation)

* Duel entry = small token fee → partially burned
* PixelShop purchases = tokens burned or locked
* Leaderboard wins = optional burn for cosmetic flex
* Treasury votes = community-decided burn events
