# 🧠 DexHunt Litepaper — Skill-Based Crypto Gaming, Done Right

## 🎯 What is DexHunt?

**DexHunt** is a Solana-powered, reflex-based arcade game.  
It’s play-to-win — not play-to-wait, stake-to-hope, or pray-to-the-APY-gods.

You click fast. You win.  
You miss? You lose.

No luck. No scams. Just speed.

## 💸 The Token — $DEXHUNT

$DEXHUNT fuels the ecosystem:

- Used in-game for utility-based rewards
- Earned by skill — not speculation
- No premines, no hidden emissions, no team wallets

💡 **$DEXHUNT is a testnet-only token during Beta. No real-world value until launch.**

**Launch**: [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/YOUR_TOKEN_LINK)
