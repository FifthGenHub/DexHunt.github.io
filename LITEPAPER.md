## 🎯 What is DexHunt?

**DexHunt: Reflex Showdown** is a Solana-powered, reflex-based arcade game.  
It’s play-to-win — not play-to-wait, stake-to-hope, or pray-to-the-APY-gods.

You click fast. You win.  
You miss? You lose.

No luck. No scams. Just speed.

**_🗓️ Updated: May 15 2025 — DexHunt: Reflex Showdown Beta is now live with mock payouts and reflex duel logic fully integrated._**

## 💸 The Token — $DEXHUNT

$DEXHUNT fuels the ecosystem:

- Used in-game for utility-based rewards
- Earned by skill — not speculation
- No premines, no hidden emissions, no team wallets
- Launch via Pump.fun — fair launch, no presale

💡 **$DEXHUNT is a testnet-only token during Beta. No real-world value until launch.**
